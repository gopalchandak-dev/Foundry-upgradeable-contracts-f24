## Web3 Upgradeable Smart Contract Project

**hey folks!
This is a smart contract repository that was produced as part of the learning and development process.**


## About 

### Introduction:

**Welcome to the Web3 Upgradeable Smart Contract project! Upgradeable smart contracts offer flexibility and adaptability, allowing for seamless updates and improvements without disrupting the contract's core functionality or requiring users to migrate to a new contract address.**

>### Features:

1. **Proxy Contracts:** Utilize proxy contracts to separate the logic contract from the proxy contract, enabling seamless upgrades without changing the contract address visible to users.
2. **Upgradeable Libraries:** Employ upgradeable libraries to modularize contract logic and enable independent upgrades to specific functionalities.

>### Project Structure:

1. **Contracts Directory:** Contains Solidity smart contract files.

>>>**->Logic Contracts:**  Holds the primary logic for the smart contract functionalities.\
>>> **->Proxy Contracts:** Includes proxy contracts to delegate calls to logic contracts.\
>>> **->Libraries:** Contains reusable libraries for specific functionalities.
2. **Tests Directory:** Contains unit tests for the smart contracts.

3. **Scripts Directory:** Includes deployment scripts and utilities for managing upgradeable contracts.

>## Foundry

> **Foundry is a blazing fast, portable and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development written in Rust.**
